## Description 
MorbidMeter is on [Android](http://www.android.com) as
an app widget.  MorbidMeter is a perverse little program that puts
your lifespan into perspective using various timescales that are
easier (or sometimes harder) to grasp than an actual lifetime.

Time is running out -- MorbidMeter lets you know how quickly!
