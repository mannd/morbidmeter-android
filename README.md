## Description
MorbidMeter is a perverse app that puts your lifespan into perspective using various timescales
that are easier (or sometimes harder) to grasp than an actual lifetime.
MorbidMeter can also be used as a countdown widget to count down
to other (not as morbid) events, such as retirement or graduation.
Time is running out -- MorbidMeter lets you know how quickly!

Morbidmeter-android has been imported from Eclipse into Android Studio,
and now combines the original 4 MorbidMeter repositories into one repository.
Only this repository will be maintained as of this point (starting October 27, 2014).
Note that this project is separate from the original MorbidMeter project,
which is a Python program and is situated in the MorbidMeter repository here on GitHub.
