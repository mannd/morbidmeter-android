## Description
MorbidMeter-android is an [Android](http://www.android.com) app widget.

Morbidmeter-android has been imported from Eclipse into Android Studio, and now combines the original 4 MorbidMeter repositories into one repository containing 4 modules.  Only this repository will be maintained as of this point (starting October 27, 2014).  Note that this project is separate from the original MorbidMeter project, which is a Python program and is situated in the MorbidMeter repository here on GitHub.  The modules contained in this repository are:

### morbidmeterandroid
This is just a thin wrapper around morbidmeterlib
which is a shared library that contains all the MorbidMeter code.
Morbidmeter-android is the full version of MorbidMeter.

### morbidmeterlite
This is another thin wrapper around morbidmeterlib.  This is the "lite" version of MorbidMeter, containing fewer configuration options.

### morbidmeterlib
This contains the source code common to the full and lite versions of MorbidMeter.  MorbidMeter is a perverse app that puts
your lifespan into perspective using various timescales that are
easier (or sometimes harder) to grasp than an actual lifetime.
MorbidMeter can also be used as a countdown widget to countdown
to other (not necessarily morbid) events, such as retirement or
graduation.

Time is running out -- MorbidMeter lets you know how quickly!

### morbidmetertest
This module contains unit testing code for MorbidMeter.
