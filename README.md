## Description
MorbidMeter is a perverse app that puts your lifespan into perspective using various timescales
that are easier (or sometimes harder) to grasp than an actual lifetime.
MorbidMeter can also be used as a countdown widget to count down
to other (not as morbid) events, such as retirement or graduation.
Time is running out -- MorbidMeter lets you know how quickly!
