## Description
MorbidMeter is soon to appear on [Android](http://www.android.com) as a home
page widget.  MorbidMeter is a perverse little program that puts your lifespan
into perspective using various timescales that are easier (or sometimes
harder) to grasp than an actual lifetime.

Time is running out -- MorbidMeter lets you know how quickly!
