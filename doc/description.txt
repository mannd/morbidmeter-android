MorbidMeter is a perverse little widget that puts your lifespan into perspective using various timescales that are easier (or sometimes harder) to grasp than an actual lifetime.  The program takes your date of birth, your estimated life-span, today's date, and a unit of time (year, hour, minute, month, and others) and generates where (when?) you are right now in that time unit.  For example, if you select year as your timescale, the month, day and time will indicate how far along you are in that year, assuming your life ends at midnight on December 31st.  Use a life expectancy calculator such as this one (http://www.livingto100.com) to figure out how long you should live (or just make up the number).  Per Wikipedia (as of 12/31/2011) the average US lifespan is 78.3 years overall: 75.6 years for men and 80.8 years for women (36th in rank of all countries, tied with Cuba).

Time is running out -- MorbidMeter lets you know how quickly!

Hints:

To setup MorbidMeter, do a long press on your screen, select Widgets, and select MorbidMeter.  For Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), press the Apps button, switch to the Widgets tab, then long press on the MorbidMeter widget.

MorbidMeter updates every half-hour automatically.  Press the skull button to get an instant update.

Try out different timescales.  You can reverse time and in some timescales can add msecs, which can increase with disturbing rapidity.

MorbidMeter remembers its startup configuration.  To change the configuration, delete the widget (long press and drag it to the trash) and then restart it.

MorbidMeter is a good way to remind you that nothing lasts forever. Not even you.
