    <string name="help_message">MorbidMeter tracks your lifespan over an alternative timescale.
        Example: Using a single year as a time scale and an estimated longevity of 80 years,
        a person in their 40s would have a MorbidMeter date sometime in the summer; using a day-long
        timescale, it would be around noon.\nFill in your user name, your birth date, and your
        predicted longevity in years.  Pick a timescale.  The timescales are self-explanatory.
        You might want to know that the AGE timescale gives your age in total days, the PERCENT just
        gives the percentage of you life you have lived, and UNIVERSE stretches your life to the life
        of the universe, conveniently estimated at 15 billion years.\nYou can reverse time
        and add milliseconds to some of the timescales.  You can have multiple different MorbidMeter widgets
        on your screen with different parameters.  Long press and drag to the trash any MorbidMeter widget
        that you are done with.  MorbidMeter updates automatically every half-hour.  Press the Skull
        to update immediately.
